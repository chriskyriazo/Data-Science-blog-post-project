## Introduction ##
In this project, I did the analysis for the Seattle Airbnb dataser. This is public data which I took from Kaggle.
For this analysis, I focused in answering these three questions:

1.What time of year do house prices go up ?
2.Which amenities do Airbnb hosts mostly use for their houses ?
3.Does high review mean higher price for each neighbourhood?

## Result Summary ##
After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:

1.Summer seems to be the season with the higher prices for housing. And winter comes second. This concludes that during vacations the house prices go up.
2.All the amenities Seattle houses provide are 42 in total. The most common are Wireless Internet, Heating, Kitchen and Smoke detector
3.High reviews doesnt mean that the houses in the particular neighbourhood would be higher
