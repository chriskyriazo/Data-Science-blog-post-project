## Introduction ##
In this project, I did the analysis for the Seattle Airbnb dataset which you can find in [Seattle Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). <br />
This is public data which I took from Kaggle.
For this analysis, I focused in answering these three questions:

1.What time of year do house prices go up ? <br />
2.Which amenities do Airbnb hosts mostly use for their houses ? <br />
3.Does high review mean higher price for each neighbourhood? <br />

In order to answer the first question i only worked on the calendar.csv. <br />
As for the next two i used the listings.csv

## Result Summary ##
After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found: <br />

1.Summer seems to be the season with the higher prices for housing. And winter comes second. This concludes that during vacations the house prices go up. <br />
2.All the amenities Seattle houses provide are 42 in total. The most common are Wireless Internet, Heating, Kitchen and Smoke detector. <br />
3.High reviews doesnt mean that the houses in the particular neighbourhood would be higher.
