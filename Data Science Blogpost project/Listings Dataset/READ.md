# Description  </br >
In this analysis i use the listings.csv in order to answer two question.</br >
1.Which are the most common amenities? </br >
2.Does high or low average review means the same for the house prices per neighborhood. </br >
</br >
This csv contained many more columns and characteristics but i used the ones that i needed in order to complete my analysis. </br >
For the amenities i used only the amenities column which contained long string values which contained multiple amenities per value in this format '{amenity1,amenit2,....}' </br >
For the next question i used the columns : </br >
1. id = the id number of each house </br >
2. neighbourhood_group_cleansed = the name of each neighborhood </br >
3. review_scores_rating = the review rating score with a scale from 0 to 100 </br >
